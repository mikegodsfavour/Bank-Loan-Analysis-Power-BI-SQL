## Project Overview
This project is a guided data analytics project developed as part of my learning journey in Power BI and SQL, within the finance domain. The objective of the analysis is to evaluate bank loan data in order to understand loan application trends, repayment performance, and overall loan health.

The project involves end-to-end data analysis, including data extraction using SQL, data cleaning and transformation, data modeling, KPI creation, and interactive dashboard development in Power BI. Key business questions such as total loan applications, funded amounts, loan status (good vs bad loans), interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and regional loan distribution were analyzed and visualized.
The dataset and project structure were sourced from a guided tutorial by Swapnjeet (Data Tutorial by Swapnjeet). While the data and problem framework were provided, all queries, transformations, and dashboard implementations were executed independently to ensure a full understanding of the analytical process.


## Project Scope
The scope of this project is to perform an end-to-end analysis of bank loan data using SQL and Power BI in order to gain insights into loan performance within the finance domain.

**The project focuses on:**

- Importing and managing loan data in a SQL database.

- Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.

- Creating a data model suitable for analytical reporting.

- Defining and calculating key financial and risk-related KPIs.

- Analyzing loan performance based on status, region, purpose, and term.

- Designing interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize insights and trends.

## Project Objectives

**The main objectives of this project are to:**

- Analyze bank loan data to understand overall loan performance and trends.

- Identify patterns between good loans and bad loans based on customer and loan attributes.

- Measure key financial KPIs such as total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, average interest rate, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.

- Evaluate loan performance across different dimensions including loan status, region (state), loan purpose, term, and home ownership Build an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

- Strengthen practical skills in SQL querying, data cleaning, data modeling, and data visualization.

- Demonstrate the ability to translate raw financial data into meaningful business insights.

This project aims to simulate a real-world finance analytics scenario while serving as a portfolio project to showcase analytical thinking and technical proficiency.
