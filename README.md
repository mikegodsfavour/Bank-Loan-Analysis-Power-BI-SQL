## Project Overview
This project is a guided data analytics project developed as part of my learning journey in Power BI and SQL, within the finance domain. The objective of the analysis is to evaluate bank loan data in order to understand loan application trends, repayment performance, and overall loan health.

The project involves end-to-end data analysis, including data extraction using SQL, data cleaning and transformation, data modeling, KPI creation, and interactive dashboard development in Power BI. Key business questions such as total loan applications, funded amounts, loan status (good vs bad loans), interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and regional loan distribution were analyzed and visualized.
The dataset and project structure were sourced from a guided tutorial by Swapnjeet (Data Tutorial by Swapnjeet). While the data and problem framework were provided, all queries, transformations, and dashboard implementations were executed independently to ensure a full understanding of the analytical process.


## Project Scope
The scope of this project is to perform an end-to-end analysis of bank loan data using SQL and Power BI in order to gain insights into loan performance within the finance domain.

**The project focuses on:**

- Importing and managing loan data in a SQL database.

- Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.

- Creating a data model suitable for analytical reporting.

- Defining and calculating key financial and risk-related KPIs.

- Analyzing loan performance based on status, region, purpose, and term.

- Designing interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize insights and trends.

## Project Objectives

**The main objectives of this project are to:**

- Analyze bank loan data to understand overall loan performance and trends.

- Identify patterns between good loans and bad loans based on customer and loan attributes.

- Measure key financial KPIs such as total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, average interest rate, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.

- Evaluate loan performance across different dimensions including loan status, region (state), loan purpose, term, and home ownership Build an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

- Strengthen practical skills in SQL querying, data cleaning, data modeling, and data visualization.

- Demonstrate the ability to translate raw financial data into meaningful business insights.

This project aims to simulate a real-world finance analytics scenario while serving as a portfolio project to showcase analytical thinking and technical proficiency.

## Expected Outcome

**By completing this project, the expected outcomes are:**

- A well-structured and cleaned bank loan dataset ready for analysis

- Clear visibility into overall loan performance, including total applications, funded amounts, and repayment trends

- Identification of good vs bad loan patterns based on borrower characteristics and loan attributes

- Insights into how factors such as loan purpose, term length, region, home ownership, and employment length influence loan outcomes

- An interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore trends, filter data, and monitor key financial KPIs

- Improved understanding of financial domain concepts such as loan risk, default behavior, and portfolio performance

- Demonstration of end-to-end data analytics capabilities using SQL and Power BI for portfolio and academic purposes

- The final deliverable provides actionable insights and a strong foundation for decision-making simulations in the banking and finance domain.

## Document Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to provide a clear and structured explanation of the Bank Loan Analysis project carried out using SQL and Power BI. It outlines the project’s objectives, scope, data sources, analytical approach, and key insights derived from the analysis.

This document serves to:

- Explain the business problem and analytical goals of the project

- Describe the dataset structure and data preparation steps

- Document the SQL queries and Power BI techniques used

- Highlight key KPIs and insights generated from the analysis

- Provide transparency on the guided nature of the project for learning and portfolio purposes

The documentation is intended for reviewers, recruiters, instructors, and peers to understand the methodology, tools used, and analytical thinking applied throughout the project.

## Use Case

This analysis can be used by financial institutions, loan officers, and risk management teams to monitor and evaluate the performance of a bank’s loan portfolio.

**The insights generated from this project support use cases such as:**

- Assessing overall loan portfolio health and identifying risk exposure.

- Tracking trends in loan applications, approvals, and repayments over time.

- Identifying high-risk loan categories based on loan purpose, region, or customer profile.

- Comparing performance between good loans and bad loans to improve credit decision-making.

- Supporting management with data-driven insights through interactive dashboards.

Although this project is conducted for learning and portfolio demonstration, it reflects real-world scenarios commonly encountered in banking and financial analytics.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from a guided tutorial by Swapnjeet (Data Tutorial by Swapnjeet) as part of a learning-based Power BI and SQL project.

The data represents bank loan records within the finance domain

It includes information related to loan applications, customer profiles, loan status, interest rates, funded amounts, and repayment details

The dataset was provided specifically for educational and portfolio development purposes

Data was supplied in a structured format and imported into a SQL Server database for analysis

All data cleaning, transformation, querying, and visualization were independently performed as part of the project to ensure a full understanding of the analytical workflow.

## Data Cleaning and Processing

The data analysis process involved a systematic approach using SQL and Power BI to transform raw bank loan data into meaningful insights.

**Key analysis steps included:**

*Data Exploration:*
- Reviewed the raw dataset to understand data structure, variable definitions, and key financial attributes.

*Data Cleaning:*
- Handled missing values, corrected data types, standardized date formats, and ensured data consistency to prepare the dataset for analysis.

*SQL Analysis:*
- Wrote SQL queries to calculate key metrics such as:

  - Total loan applications.
  - Total funded amount.
  - Total amount received.
  - Average interest rate.
  - Average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.
  - Good vs bad loan distribution.

*Trend & Segmentation Analysis:*
- Analyzed loan performance across multiple dimensions including:
  - Time (monthly trends by issue date).
  - Geography (state-wise analysis).
  - Loan purpose and term.
  - Home ownership and employment length.

Visualization & Reporting:
Connected Power BI to the SQL database to build interactive dashboards featuring KPIs, charts, slicers, and drill-through views for deeper analysis.

## What I Learned

Through this guided Bank Loan Analysis project, I developed and strengthened essential data analytics skills by working through a complete end-to-end finance use case using SQL and Power BI.

**Key learnings from this project include:**

- Gaining hands-on experience writing SQL queries to perform financial analysis, calculate KPIs, and segment loan data based on business requirements

- Understanding the importance of data cleaning and validation to ensure accurate analysis before building visualizations

- Learning how to create and use a date table to enable time intelligence functions such as monthly and yearly trend analysis
  
- Building an efficient data model in Power BI, including defining relationships and optimizing tables for reporting

- Designing finance-focused dashboards that communicate insights clearly to business and non-technical users

- Developing the ability to translate raw financial data into actionable insights that support decision-making in the banking and finance domain

Overall, this project improved my analytical thinking and helped me understand how data analytics is applied in real-world financial scenarios.
